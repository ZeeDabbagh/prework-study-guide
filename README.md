# Study Guide Webpage

## Description


This web app was created to gather and sort the information shared during the bootcamp prework in a readable manner. It was created using HTML, CSS and JavaScript

The motivation for this web app was to challenge myself to build something from scratch.- This project was built to streamline the process of gathering data for notes during the prework portion of the bootcam. It makes the immense amount of information shared during the prework readable at a glance. I learned that coding is logical, and making a simple web app is not as easy as it seems
