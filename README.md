# Study Guide Webpage

## Description


This web app was created to gather and sort the information shared during the bootcamp prework in a readable manner. It was created using HTML, CSS and JavaScript

- The motivation for this web app was to challenge myself to build something from scratch
- This project was built to streamline the process of gathering data for notes during the prework portion of the bootcam
- This web app makes the immense amount of information shared during the prework readable at a glance
- I learned that coding is logical, and making a simple web app is not as easy as it seems
